# Fast Food Data Structures
### Ready-to-use minimal data structures for making proof-of-concepts or demos

Some of these data structures wrap around standard library structures to deliberately make them barebones, while some are built from scratch. You can see the `.h` files in the `src` folder to get an idea of what a data structure can do. The `examples` folder contains some simple examples to demonstrate how to use these data structures.

Some use cases:

1. A teacher wants to give a demo to his/her class on _insertion in the middle of a Linked List_ without using any built-in functions.
2. An student wants to solve interview questions that often restrict certain functionality on a data structure e.g. the size of stack is not known or the linked list is singly linked.
